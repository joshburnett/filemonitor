File Monitor To-Do List

x proper colors for each line (cycles through 8 colors)
x legend (with user-configurable position)
	x names for each data field (dependent on having a legend)
x configurable window title

x show file location in status bar
x show file time stamp in status bar

x auto-refresh option (actually monitor the file)

x move 'live update' toggle, config, etc. buttons to toolbar

x plot last N points / plot all points
	x N field dependent on choice

x button to reload file
x X axis label
x formatting help in Pattern Field tool tip
x 'clear' button to clear parsed data and continue parsing

x changing the search string clears the history
	- What about storing X vector for each line?  What are the implications for exporting? (what was this?)

x Give configuration dialog a proper name
x fix legend positioning bug (changing legend position is buggy)
x change formatting field to a combo box, with the drop-down items coming from a text file in the home directory

x auto-generate format string from the current string (replace all numbers with '%f') (magic wand icon for button)
- allow drag-and-drop of the log file to open it

- auto-suggest format string from file analysis?
	- check the first 100-1k lines, turn each one into a auto-generated string, pick the one with the largest number of entries
	- do the same as above, but present the user with a dialog to choose between the top X options (maybe 5?)



- plot Y vs X
	- 'reset' search string

- export data as CSV file

- toggle autoscale Y axis

- Include a size change as an update (sometimes Hyperterminal appends to a file without changing it's modification timestamp)
- check that file has actually gotten *longer*.  Reset position to end if shorter.


- save/load configuration?

- use a plot manager to allow for signal selection, other toolbars, zooming, etc (way more advanced)
